    "# Effects of  attention on Covid analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know that influential people talked about Covid and that the general population did express interest in this topic. However, we notice there exists a difference between the levels of attention on Covid between countries: For some countries, this attention from both the general public and influential people is very high, while for some others, it is significantly lower. Hence, we would like to examine if countries' attention to the Covid had certain effect on the percentage of people infected with coronavirus. Did high attnetion towards Covid in early stages of pandemic help people fight it, or was it simply a sign that a country immediatly faced a difficult situation when the virus first started spreading?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial idea of this part is to quantify the overall interest in Covid (e.g, on Wikipedia) and its presence in social media (e.g., Twitter) in the period that preceded the official lockdowns (or any other similar measure, e.g., school closure or ban of the public events\", for countries that did not impose the official lockdowns) through a measure we call the attention score. Then we compare the number of Covid infections between some similar countries with different attention scores and try to draw conclusions based on the results we get.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period we take into account when we compute the attention score is the same as in the previous parts: 3 weeks before the lockdown starts in each country, as during this period Covid spread reached its peak across countries, so we want to inspect how influential people and general public's attention on Covid help (or not?) country fight pandemic when, in essence, this was the only way to set people behavior, e.g., staying at home, avoiding social contacts, before this behavior was imposed by governments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, to compare the number of Covid infections, we use 45 days since the start of the lockdown in each respective country, comparing the number of new infections per day for each of them. We chose this interval as the effects of Covid’s spread, people’s behavior, and attention given to Covid during the pre-lockdown term are most visible at the beginning of the lockdown when coronavirus reaches its peak before lockdown mitigates its spread. On the other hand, we want to be careful about the length of the period we use for comparison. If it is too long, the influences of various confounders could strongly impact the results, e.g., the strictness of the government measures, competence of the countries when handling crises situations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline in this notebook includes:\n",
    "1. Computing the `covid attention score` for each country\n",
    "2. Create a new dataset describing each county, their policies, and general situation during the first wave of the pandemic\n",
    "3. Add number of infections for each country per day for period of 45 days starting on the first day of the lockdown \n",
    "4. Match up countries with different `covid attention score` based on their similarities \n",
    "5. Apply paired t-test and compute CI between series of daily Covid infections of countries in the pair in order to check if there exists statistical evidence that the mean differnece is different from zero"

    "1. Twitter data of influential people - represents the presence of Covid in the media\n",
    "2. Wikipedia pageviews - represent the people's general interest in Covid\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the key topics talked about by influential people on Twitter, we utilize the Linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We minimize the perplexity score given by the LDA to find out how many and what topics were discussed by influential people from each country. Thus, we can recognize a topic that is related to the pandemic, Covid, lockdown, etc., and compute the percentage of tokens associated with this topic. This percentage is the score we use to quantify the presence of Covid on social media for each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the `aggregated_timeseries.json` dataset to get the average percentage of pageviews going to covid-related pages per day for pages in the appropriate language for the country we analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to compute the Covid attention score, we find the harmonic mean between the score obtained by LDA and the average Wikipedia covid pageview score. We use the harmonic mean to evenly weigh the influence of each of the percentage scores applied. For example, 1% of pageviews to covid-related pages represent a very significant interest in Covid compared to the number of topics available on Wikipedia. On the other hand, the number of topics we can explore by topic analysis is many orders of magnitude smaller, so significant attention to Covid is characterized by a larger percentage. "

    "Finally, we update our `countries` dataset with the outcomes of the Covid pandemic for each country. We choose to look at the time series for the number of infections/cases per day in proportion to the country's population for period of 45 days starting on the first day of the each country's lockdown. We chose this interval as the effects of Covid’s spread, people’s behavior, and attention given to Covid during the pre-lockdown term are most visible at the beginning of the lockdown when coronavirus reaches its peak before lockdown mitigates its spread. On the other hand, we want to be careful about the length of the period we use for comparison. If it is too long, the influences of various confounders could strongly impact the results, e.g., the strictness of the government measures, competence of the countries when handling crises situations, etc. "

    "Results that we obtained from paired t-tests and confidence intervals suggest that in most of the cases, countries with more attention towards Covid at the early stages of the pandemic had more daily infections proportionally to their population than those with less attention. Thus, we can hypothesize that speaking about Covid and giving it a lot of interest and attention was not the way to fight Covid at the early stages of the pandemic, but it was a natural reaction of the population caused by the fast spread of this virus in a country. In other words, it could happen that people talked and searched about Covid more because of the general fear and panic of its fast spreading to try to find a way to protect themselves, and not to warn about it and prevent its spread. Hence in that case, we would have countries where Covid was not seen as an immediate treatment and simply did not get the same level of treatment (at least not at the beginning) there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do have to emphasize that there could be many potential confounders that we cannot observe or quantify and that influence the results quite significantly. For instance, the mentality of the people of a country could be an interesting such confounder (people of some countries tend to be more rebellious towards government's instructions than others, leaner to panic in a crisis, etc.). In addition, the results we got are a direct consequence of the parameters and data that we set and obtained manually. Although we tried to balance data gathered from Twitter as much as possible, it could happen that the results we have do not reflect the level of attention that was realistically given to Covid, or simply Twitter is not a reliable source to determine the topics talked about in particular countries.  Finally, changing parameters like the length of the observation periods for finding attention and comparing Covid spread rates may result in some different findings."
