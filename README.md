## Abstract: 
2020 was a year of big changes in the world. During the coronavirus pandemic, more than 4M people were infected and more than 15K people died. Because of reduced mobility during that period people started to live in an ‘online’ world, expressing their thoughts and opinions on social media like Twitter. Wikipedia also had a big role during that period as the main source for investigating more about viruses, and previous pandemics, but also about different topics for which earlier they didn't have enough free time to explore.
The goal of this project is to use human digital traces to understand how the pandemic has impacted human needs and interests.

## Research questions:
Starting from West et al.’s work about attention shifts on Wikipedia during the COVID-19 crisis, we want to retrieve additional information from Twitter in order to answer the following questions:

1) How have people's interests in different topics on Wikipedia and Twitter changed during different periods of the pandemic in different countries? Is there any correlation between these two? Do tweets reflect the same changes in volume and nature of information seeking as shown by Wikipedia pageview logs? Do COVID-19-related tweets have a distribution similar to one of Wikipedia pages, with peaks and sudden increases around mobility changepoints?

2) Did influential people post more negative or positive messages using Twitter? Did this reflect the situation going on in each country (e.g., regarding the topics searched, interests in COVID, respecting governments' lockdown measures, and general mobility)?

3) Did countries with a higher presence of COVID on tweeter and interest before the lockdowns (or if no official lockdowns in the country, we could detect the points of high-reduction of mobility, a kind of alternate normalcy feature from Coronawiki) have a better COVID situation than countries that didn’t?

## Datasets:
To answer those questions we used the following datasets (given):
- `Global_Mobility_Report`: in this dataset are collected all the metrics regarding mobility.
- `aggregated_timeseries`: here we find the date and the number of clicks on wikipedia pages of different topics (e.g. Covid, Geography, STEM, ...)
- `interventions`: in this dataset we can find all the date of the most important events during the pandemics for some countries.  
We have also decided to add the following dataset to have a better understanding in our analysis on how pandemics was going:
- `WHO-COVID-19-global-data`: dataset downloaded from the official website of World Health Organization [(here)](https://covid19.who.int/data)
